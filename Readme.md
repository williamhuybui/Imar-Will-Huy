Technologies
Visualization on Tableau
Codes: on python, using pandas, numpy, sklearn, and other small libraries.
Project Description
The 2010 data set is consist of 1461 house prices in Ames, Iowa. Each house has 79 features which almost describe all aspect of a house. The data can be found on Kaggle .

The executive presentation can be found in the powerpoint file

Chalenges
It is hard to preprocess and engineer all 79 features without domain knowledge such as: what to fill in nan values, what to group by, what to exclude.

Future work
The model can be recycled for a more updated version of the data.

It would be more interesting to see how the listing prices changes over time.
